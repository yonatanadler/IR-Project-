# IR-Project

This repo presents a search engine project on the entire Wikipedia corpus for information retrival course at BGU.

## Content

- IndexerGCP - Folder contains 9 .ipynb files for our indexes builders, pre-made calculations for better running time and one python file that builds the Inverted Index structure:

  - Indexes builders:

    - title_index - creates the titles extraction for each doc from the entire corpus.
    - stem_title_index - creates the titles extraction with stemming for each doc from the entire corpus.
    - body_index - creates the text extraction for each doc from the entire corpus.
    - stem_body_index - creates the text extraction with stemming for each doc from the entire corpus.
    - anchor_index - creates the anchor text extraction for each doc from the entire corpus.

  - Pre-made calculations:

    - page_rank - makes dictionary of page rank for each document from the entire corpus.
    - page_view - makes dictionary of page view for each document from the entire corpus.

  - Inverted Index:

    - inverted_index_gcp_new - builds the Inverted Index structure for our indexes.

- RunApps - Folder contains all the relevent files we got to run the project in GCP

- Evaluation - Folder contains file to evaluate our engine by few different evaluation methods and json file for training our engine. this file helped us find the right parameters and weights for the retrival methods we used.

- backend - python file contains all the back function we use for our engine.

- bm25 - python file contains implementation of BM-25 method.

- search_frontend - python file contains the front part of our engine, uses the calculations from backend file and.

## Retrieval Methods

In this project we support five different ranking methods called from search_frontend file:

- Search - returns top 10 best result for query using BM-25, binary scoring for title and PageRank.
- Search_body - returns up to a 100 search results for the query using tf-idf and cosine aimilarity of the body of articles only.
- Search_title - binary ranking, returns all search results that contain a query word in the title of articles.
- search_anchor - binary ranking, returns all search results that contain a query word in the anchor text of articles.
- get_pagerank - Returns PageRank values for a list of provided wiki article IDs.
- get_pageview - Returns the number of page views that each of the provide wiki articles.

## Evaluation

We evaluated our engine using MAP@40. Our engine average score is 0.747 and the average retrival time is 3.43 sec.
